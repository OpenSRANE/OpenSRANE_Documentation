.. function:: PhysicalEffect.VCE_TNT(tag, Etta=0.03)



   This module is for modelling Vapor Cloud explosion with TNT model [Ref.1]_. This model doesnâ€™t work if no gas dispersion calculated in corresponding dispersion model in the previous step. So, the defined dispersion model should consider gas dispersion and if it models only liquid spread so no results will be back.
