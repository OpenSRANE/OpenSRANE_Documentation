Objects (Concept)
*****************

|opr| is an object oriented programming. Any |opr| commands creats an object and all created objects will be saved by |opr| internally and in this :ref:`page <Acs2Obj>` the method of accessing them has been described. However, created objects can be assigned to variables and be used in other code lines. A sample of the latter case is available on :ref:`This page <WindRose>`.
