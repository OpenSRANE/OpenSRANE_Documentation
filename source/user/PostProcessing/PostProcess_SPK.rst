.. _PostProcessSPK:

*************************
PostProcess SubPackage
*************************

Using this subpackage, user can export easily some specific data or results or plots from the recorders and user do not need to write code for post processing. Currently there are ObjsRecorder and Recorder modules for recording. In the following, some commands that has been provided are described for exporting some results from recorded data.

.. note::

   Using the results in the form of this section for post processing is not mandatory and users can use their own code on the resulted values from analysis of the software. Also, users can develope the current module for post processing or add their modules or methods to the source code for further usages. 
   
.. _First Step:

First Step: Create PostProcess Object
-------------------------------------
   
   At very fist step, user should create the object of post processing. By creating this object, its constructor load data and get the results. For :ref:`Objs_recorder <Objsrecorder>` and :ref:`Recorder <Recorder>` there are a specific command for this purpose. These commands are described in the following:
   
   * To create post process object for recorded data via :ref:`Objs_recorder <Objsrecorder>` use the following command. In this command **filename** is the name of recoded file using :ref:`Objs_recorder <Objsrecorder>` recorder. All the statistical analysis and data will be in this created object. (In the following examples the created object is named Post_Process_Object)
   
      .. code-block:: python
	     
         import opensrane as opr
  
         Post_Process_Object=opr.PostProcess.ObjsRecorderPP(ObjsRecorer_filename=filename, Number_Of_LOC_Histogram_Bins=100)
   
   * To create post process object for recorded data :ref:`Recorder <Recorder>` use the following command. When user is using :ref:`Recorder <Recorder>` to record data and results, there are one separated file for each desired result and so finally there will be more than one file for recorded results. In this command **Recorder_FilenamesList** is the list of the recoded files name using :ref:`Recorder <Recorder>` recorder. All the statistical analysis and data will be in this created object. In the following sample it is assumed that user recorded the desired results in the mentioned file names. 
   
      .. code-block:: python
	     
         import opensrane as opr
  
         Post_Process_Object=opr.PostProcess.RecorderPP(Recorder_FilenamesList=['RecorderA.OPRrec','RecorderB.OPRrec','RecorderC.OPRrec','RecorderD.OPRrec','RecorderE.OPRrec'],Number_Of_LOC_Histogram_Bins=100)

Second Step: Methods
--------------------

   By creating the post process object, various methods will be available for user that contains various results or plots that are resulted from recorded results by recorder object/s. In the following tables these methods and their its results are described.

   .. admonition:: Example:
   
      The following demonstrates the use of the mentioned command. 
   
      **Python Code**
   
      .. code-block:: python
      
         import opensrane as opr
		
         Post_Process_Object=opr.PostProcess.ObjsRecorderPP('Recorder',100)
		 
         Post_Process_Object.plot_Expected_Total_LOC('log')
    
      The result of above command is:

* **plot_ScenarioProbability**
   
   Using this command probability of scenarios will be plotted.

   .. function:: PPost_Process_Object.plot_ScenarioProbability(yaxistype='log',DamageLevel=[],ScenarioList=[],PlotMode=1,)
   
   .. csv-table:: 
      :header: "Argument", "Type", "Description"
      :widths: 10, 10, 40
   
      yaxistype, str, "Type of the yaxis ['linear', 'log', 'date', 'category','multicategory']"
      PlotMode, int, "Options between 1,2 and 3 to plot on various editors."
	  DamageLevel, list of int, List of damage level that user want to watch the results
	  ScenarioList, list of str, List of scenarios that want to be shown in plot. (for Empty it means that plot all scenarios)
	  
	  
   .. admonition:: Example:
   
      The following demonstrates the use of the mentioned command. 
   
      **Python Code**
   
      .. code-block:: python
      
         import opensrane as opr
		
         Post_Process_Object=opr.PostProcess.ObjsRecorderPP('Recorder',100)
		 
         Post_Process_Object.plot_ScenarioProbability('log',)
    
      The result of above command is:
	  
      .. raw:: html
          :file: figures/ScenarioProbability.html
      
      |

      And to plot just for damage level 0 and 1
	  
      .. code-block:: python
      
         import opensrane as opr
		
         Post_Process_Object=opr.PostProcess.ObjsRecorderPP('Recorder',100)
		 
         Post_Process_Object.plot_ScenarioProbability('log',DamageLevel=[0,1],)
		 
      .. raw:: html
          :file: figures/ScenarioProbability01.html
		  

      |

      And if user wants to plot for some specific scenarios:
	  
      .. code-block:: python
		 
         Post_Process_Object.plot_ScenarioProbability('linear', ScenarioList=[f'(0):[{i}]' for i in range(1,9)],)
		 
      .. raw:: html
          :file: figures/ScenarioProbabilityScens.html
