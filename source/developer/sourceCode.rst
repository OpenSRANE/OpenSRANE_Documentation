Source Code
***********


The OpenSRANE source code is available to obtain from the |githubLink|. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

.. note::

   If you plan on collaborating or even using OpenSRANE as your base code it is highly recommended that you FORK this repo to your own account and work on it there. We will not allow anybody to push to the |githubLink|.


.. warning::

   Only PULL requests from your FORK to the main repo will be considered **AND** they will only be considered if there are **NO CONFLICTS**. 

   Pull requests which cause **CONFLICTS** will be rejected out of hand as we have no time to reconcile them.
   
   We strongly encourage you to get in the habit of keeping your FORK in synch with the main OpenSRANE repo on a regular basis to avoid said conflicts. This requires you to **merge** or rebase.

* To fork the repo click on the FORK at the top right of the |OPR|.
